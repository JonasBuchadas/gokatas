# Go katas

Katas (å½¢) are practiced in martial arts as a way to memorize and perfect the
movements being executed. Let's try the same with Go code.

## Why

I've been learning to program in Go. I work in the sysadmin/devops and security
areas so I don't get to program every day. But I still want to keep my coding
skills fresh. Maybe even improve them. I use gokatas as one of the ways to
achieve this.

## How

The approach is pretty low-tech. Go katas is basically a
[list](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jreisinger/gokatas#section-directories) of
packages and commands that you should be rewriting from scratch or partially.
There's a command to show katas and your progress:

```
$ go run cmd/katas.go -d 7 -l beginner
Kata              Last done    Done  Level     Topics
----              ---------    ----  -----     ------
areader           3 days ago     7x  beginner  interfaces, io.Reader
boring/boring     0 days ago     4x  beginner  concurrency, design
boring/channel    0 days ago     6x  beginner  goroutines, channels
----                           ----
3                                17
```

It's important to practice regularly, to create a habit. Set a goal that you can
meet, e.g. 45 minutes every day before work. At first it's fine even if you only
read through one of the beginner level katas.

After some time it will require much less will power and you will become more
familiar with the code.  If you feel comfortable enough with a kata, stop
practicing it (for some time) and pick up one that interests you and is slightly
beyond your current ability.

## Initial setup

1) [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

2) [Fork](https://github.com/jreisinger/gokatas/fork) and then clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:<you>/gokatas.git`.

3) Start practicing:

```
cd gokatas
> katas.md # if you are not me :-)
go doc
```
