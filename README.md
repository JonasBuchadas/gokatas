[Kata][1] is practiced in martial arts as a way to memorize and perfect the
movements being executed. Let's try the same with code.

```
go run cmd/katas.go     # what kata should I practice => e.g. areader
go doc areader          # what's the idea and design of the kata
vi areader              # let's practice: delete code and try to it write back
go run areader/cmd/*    # is it working?
git diff                # is it the same?
```
