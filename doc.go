/*
Package gokatas contains programming katas for memorizing and perfecting your
Go movements. Katas are brief, well written Go programs.

Here's a typical practice cycle:

    go run cmd/katas.go -a # what kata should I practice today; e.g. areader
    go doc -all areader    # what's the kata about
    vi areader             # understand, delete and try to write the code back
    vi katas.md            # write down katas you've done (go doc KatasFile)
