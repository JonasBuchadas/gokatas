/*
Package gokatas contains programming katas for memorizing and perfecting your Go
movements. Katas are simple, practical and well written Go programs.

    go run cmd/katas.go  # what kata should I practice today => e.g. areader
    go doc -all areader  # what's the idea and design of the kata
    code areader         # let's practice: delete and try to write it back
    go run areader/cmd/* # check it's working; or `git diff`
    code -a katas.md     # write down katas you've done

It's important to practice regularly, to create a habit. Start by taking baby
steps, e.g. 15 minutes a day. After some time it will require much less will
power, it will become natural for you. ðŸ¥‹
