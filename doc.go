/*
Package gokatas contains programming katas for memorizing and perfecting your Go
movements. Katas are brief, practical and well written Go programs.

Here's a typical practice cycle:

    go run cmd/katas.go -a # what kata should I practice today; e.g. areader
    go doc -all areader    # what's the kata about
    code areader           # understand, delete and try to write it back
    code -a katas.md       # go doc KatasFile
