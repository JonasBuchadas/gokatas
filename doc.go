/*
Package gokatas contains programming katas for memorizing and perfecting your
Go movements. Katas are brief, well written Go programs.

Here's a typical practice cycle:

	go run cmd/katas.go # what kata should I practice today; e.g. areader
	code areader        # understand, delete and try to write the code back
	vi katas.md         # write down katas you've done (go doc KatasFile)
